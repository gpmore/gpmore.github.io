As a cybersecurity graduate student at the University of Maryland, I am passionate about protecting organizations from evolving threats and vulnerabilities.

I have industry experience in web application security, penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, ethical hacking, and API security testing. In my most recent role as an associate information security consultant at qSEAp Infotech, I worked on critical banking applications, conducting web application security assessments and analysis in line with OWASP Top 10 standards, and managing change request approval processes. I performed API security assessments and thick-client pentesting. I am proficient in programming languages like Java, C, Bash/Shell Scripting, and SQL, and tools such as Burp Suite, Nessus, Postman, Kali Linux, Nmap, and Wireshark.

My goal is to continue making a positive impact in the field and further develop my cybersecurity skill set. I am enthusiastic about contributing my expertise to cybersecurity initiatives, and actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios.
